      For several decades now many of the clothes we wear were made in countries
      were workers' rights do not exist. Companies are exploiting and taking
      advantage of the poor population who have no other choice but to work for
      any salary in any conditions. Some workers are often forced to work up to
      14-16 hours a day, 7 days a week throughout the year often working from 2am
      to meet the companies' deadline. Unfortunely Workers are not compinsated
      for the work as companies barely pay their workers and they never pay for
      overtime. The enviroment these workes are put in are extremely deadly.
      1,134 Garment workrs have died during a texile factory collapse in Dhaka
      in 2013. 114 workers were killed in a fire at Bangladeshi firm Tazreen
      Fashions in 2013, 50 have died due to blasted sand inhalation. 5000 are
      sick due to blasted sand inhalation and exposure to harmful chemicals and
      toxins. But the most heart breaking part about this situation is most of
      these workers are youg children. 168 million children globaly are forced
      to work and because the fashion industry requires little skill child labor
      is a common issue in this industry. For example 250,000 young girls working in
      South india under the sumangali scheme; girls are being over worked in
      conditions that could classify as modern day slavery.
