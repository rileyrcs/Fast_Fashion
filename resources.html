            This documentary is an eye opening look into the fashion industry.
            As the title suggests it shows the viewer a glimpse of what the true
            cost of fast fashion is. The film takes a look at where clothing is
            made and the people who make it. It helps to humanize the fashion
            industry. We highly recommend you sit down and watch it when you
            can.</par
