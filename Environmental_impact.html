        <br />Fast fashion provides the marketplace with affordale apparel aimed
        at young women. Fashion magazines, high end partys such as the Met Gala,
        and trends created by A-list celebritys also creating a dire need for
        the ''must haves" of the season. Most people will even buy articles of
        clothing that they will never wear for the sake of keeping up with the
        latest trends. Since the clothes are cheap, people end up buying more
        and closets get full easily which in its own way created Disposable
        couture evident in Shopping centers all across the Americas and Europe
        at prices that make it tempting and dispose easily. Yet the amount of
        pollution the fast fashion industry leaves in its wake is appalling.
        Almost every step of the life cycle these clothes go through are
        riddeled with enviromental and occupational hazards. Each step of the
        clothing production process possesses potential for an enviomental
        impact. An example of this is conventionally grown cotten crops, cotton
        is a very popular clothing fiber and is used in many articles of
        clothing but it also is one of the most water and pesticide dependent
        crops and at factory stage can contain a number of toxins. Animal abuse
        is also a common sighting in the fashion industry.Because they are
        objectifying the animals' fur some companys take to harming animals by
        polluting their habitat, or disrupting the food chain while others take
        to raising the animals in captivity to shave their fur when the animals
        get to a ripe age. Both situations make it nearly impossible for the
        animals to live freely.
