        <p id="sustainable">
          Sustainable fashion can be hard to find. Brands like H&M, Forever 21,
          Shien and other fast fashion brands flood our social media feeds.
          Their trendy styles and put together ads distract us from how they
          make their clothing. The $10 shirt you were about to buy could have
          been made by an underpaid and overworked labourer, but large
          corporations aren't transparent about how their clothing is made. The
          sustainable fashion movement is a push to consume ethical clothing
          from companies that inform buyers how their products are made.

        <p id="howTo">
          In a perfect world all fashion would be sustainable, but that is not
          our reality right now. You can be a part of the sustainable fashion
          movement by being conscious about where you buy your clothing. Look at
          the website of your favorite clothing brands, try to find any
          information on how their clothing is made. If you can't find any look
          on the website Good On You. They have brands ranked on their
          sustainability. You can also use this checklist to start your ethical
          fashion journey.

            Sustainable fashion can be pricey, so are there other less
            expiensive ways to shop sustainable?
          </h2>
        </center>
        <p id="thriftFashion">
          Yes! Shopping sustainably doesn't mean breaking the bank. Thrift
          shopping and Up-cycling are great ways to be sustainable for less
          money. Hand me downs are also a great way to be sustainable! Below are
          a few examples of thrifted outfits. Each outfit cost no more than $30!

            What are other ways to live sustainably?

        <p id="OW">
          Outside of the fashion industry there are so many other ways to live
          sustainably. Buying food from a local farmers market, or reducing the
          amount of single use plastics you consume can be a great way to do
          this! A couple of easy ways to reduce plastic waste in your life are
          to use reusable grocery bags, keep a set of reusable cutlery with you,
          rather than reaching for the plastic utensils, and buy a reusable
          water bottle.
