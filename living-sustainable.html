        Buying sustainably on a budget can be tough, but the upside is that if
        you invest in your clothing it will last. Although it might not seem
        like you are saving money in the short term, long term you will have to
        buy less clothing. There are also some more cost effective ways to
        obtain an ethically sourced wardrobe. Thrifting is a good option if you
        are on a budget and you have a little bit of time to find what you want.
        Another option is upcycling. If you have old clothing that doesn't fit
        right, learning how to adjust a hem, fix a zipper, or patch a hole is
        more cost effective than buying a new piece of clothing. Below are a
        couple of tutorials that can help you star to learn some simple ways to
        fix your clothing.

        There are also other ways to live sustainably. Become aware of where
        your food, home decor, wellness, and beauty products come from. Use your
        resources to pick and choose to support sustainable companies. It may
        seem like a daunting task, but if you take it step by step you can live
        a more sustainable life.
